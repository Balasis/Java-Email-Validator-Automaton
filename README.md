A comprehensive Java program designed to validate email addresses based on customizable schemas. This program includes predefined validation rules for popular email providers such as Google and Outlook, and allows for the creation and merging of custom email validation schemas. The program ensures that email addresses conform to specific character constraints, providing a robust solution for email validation needs. While simpler methods exist for email validation, this project is an effort to mimic the logic and automata theory to create a more intricate and educational solution.
